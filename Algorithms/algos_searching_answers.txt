1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A: If you were trying to find someone that signed in for an appointment using a sign in sheet. Then you would use linear to go through that list until you find it.

2.What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A: A real world version of binary search would be walking down a hall searching for a room. Then reaching a interception with signs giving you the highest room number and the lowest room number with you being in the middle.


3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A: Seven iterations would be needed.

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: Three iterations would be needed.

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Linear would be the better algorithm due to binary cutting the collection in half based on a random item. Due to binary being useless unless the data is in order from smallest to biggest.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Binary would be best due to linear search possibly having to go the end of the collection. So since the collection is sorted from smallest to greatest it allow us to continuously divide the collection in half massively cutting the amount of iterations needed.


1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

function binary(arr, target){
	var low = arr[0];
	var high = arr[arr.length - 1];
	WHILE (low <= high){
		var mid = (arr.indexOf(low) + arr.indexOf(high)) / 2;
		if (arr[mid] > target){
			high = arr[mid -1];
		}else if (arr[mid] < target) {
			low = arr[mid + 1];
		}else {
			return arr[mid];
		}
	}
}
     


2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.


function linear(arr,target){
	for (var i = 0;i < arr.length;i++){
		if (target == arr[i]){
			return i;
		}
	}
}
