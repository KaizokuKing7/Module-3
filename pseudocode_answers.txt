Programming Assignment

1.Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
If first number is greater than second number THEN
	Print first number 
Else IF second number is greater than first number THEN
	PRINT second number
END

2.Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

Init number to 0
WHILE number less than or equal to 100
	ADD 1 to number
	PRINT number
END WHILE

3.Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT search
INIT phonebook to array
 FOR EACH entry in phonebook if equal to search
	RETURN entry

4.Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
	
function (search){
	var phonebook = []
	phonebook.foreach(function(entry) {

	if (entry === search){  
	return entry;
	}}
